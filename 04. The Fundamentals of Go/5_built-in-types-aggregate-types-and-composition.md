## **Variable Declaration**
In Go, we **declare a variable** of a certain **type**:
- A variable can only hold **values** of its declared **type**.
- Go is a **statically typed** language.

## **Basic Types / Built-in Types / Primitive Types**
  - Data types provided by a programming language as a basic building block. Most languages allow more complicated composite types to be constructed starting from these basic types.
  - Data types for which the programming language provides built-in support.
  - In most programming languages, all basic data types are built-in.
  - For more details, refer to the [Go Built-in Package Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/builtin).

## **Aggregate Types**
Aggregate types combine multiple values together.

### Examples:
- **Array**: A fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.
- **Slice**: A dynamically sized, flexible view into an array.
- **Struct**: A collection of fields that can hold values of different types.

### Composite / Compound / Struct Types:
- Include **values of different types**, e.g., `struct`.
- **Composition** is the act of constructing a `struct` (a composite type) by:
  - Combining many different **types** into one structure.
  - Creating a **data structure** that holds values of multiple **types**.
- **Combining smaller types** into a larger type.
- **Embedding types** and **inner-type promotion**:
  - Enables a struct to **inherit fields and methods** of an embedded type.

## **Go Specification Types**
Go provides a variety of built-in types, as per the [Go Specification](https://go.dev/ref/spec):
1. **Boolean**
2. **Numeric**  
3. **String**
4. **Array**
5. **Slice**
6. **Struct**
7. **Pointer**
8. **Function**
9. **Interface**
10. **Map**
11. **Channel**

## **Conclusion**
Go's robust type system ensures clarity, consistency, and safety in variable usage and data structuring. Whether youâ€™re using basic types or aggregating multiple types, Go's static typing and comprehensive specifications make it a powerful language for efficient programming.
